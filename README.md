# Web-AR

During summer 2018 I worked on an AR education project to assist kids with ADHD. The project used AR.js and A-frame combined with some normal HTML and Javascript.  

These are just samples of the scripts. No assets or project files are included.

SampleFileInteractions.html is a file that loaded an AR window in the user's browser. When a marker is detected, a GLTF model would appear in AR. This version contained and audio track, baked animations and animations that were handled upon touch input.

SampleFile.html is a simplified version of the above file. It loads a GLTF model in AR (including baked animations) but contained no other interactions.
